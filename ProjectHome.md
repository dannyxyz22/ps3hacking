Currently, two projects are being developed: Cell Computational Fluid Dynamics and Algorithms for Cell.

The hardware available for the project are 5 PlayStation3 consoles, which can be accessed through _ssh_ limited connection. The project is sponsored by IBM and the funds have been used to pay scholarships and hardware.

A side projected developed by the intern Fernando is a VRAM access kernel module available at http://comos.cvs.sourceforge.net/comos/cell-hacks/vram/ . This module differs from the current implementations since it does not rely on lv1 hypervisor kernel API. Together with it, it has the group's own implementation of lv1 API "caller", that might enable a more straight foward API for communicating with SPE.

All research developed is reported in RePorts

The projects is being mentorized by ITA Professor Dr. Celso Massaki Hirata, IBM's University Relation Mauro Assano, and ITA student Daniel Lélis Baggio.

The interns from the project are ITA students André Keller Abadie and Igor Aquino, as well as GV/IME student Fernando Fernandes Neto.
