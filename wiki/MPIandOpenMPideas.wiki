#summary First ideas about using MPI and OpenMP on cell programming
#labels OpenMP,MPI

= Introduction =

This post talks about some ideas given by people who work at wind tunnel in Sao Jose dos Campos - SP. They work on CFD codes that run on a cluster and had already parallelized some CFD simulations.

= Details =

These are topics talked on meeting at wind tunnel:
  * *Metis*: software used for partitioning CFD grid in smaller grids in order to distribute those grids among processors on cluster;
  * *MPICH2*: MPI version used by them. They have never tried another MPI version to make a benchmark and check each performance. MPICH2 already has a Fortran 90 compiler. Besides, they also talked about a software called [http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/perfvis/software/viewers/index.htm Jumpshot], which is a Java-based visualization tool for doing postmortem performance analysis;
  * *Language*: They all program in Fortran 77;
  * *CFD open source*: There is an open source CFD community called [http://www.frecfd.com frecfd];
  * *Ensight - CEI*: software for image view and animation;
  * *Tecplot*: CFD and numerical simulation software package used in post-processing simulation results;
  * *Their code*: As they program in Fortran, they spend a lot of memory to run their software, because it is not used dynamic memory allocation
  * *C++ code*: There was a project that involved many universities and [http://www.embraer.com.br Embraer] to translate Fortran code to C++ and improve it. That project finished on 2006 and have never been used again by wind tunnel group. Maybe (or not) Embraer group uses that C++ version of CFD code;
  * *F2C*: software for converting Fortran code to C++. It works well for small and simple Fortran codes, but is not so good for complex codes;
